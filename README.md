## Reflection

### What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
I wish I would have drawn out and written some ideas down before editing everything.

### Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
The media queries were a bit challenging to get used to with different screen sizes. Having a set template would have made it easier.

### What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?
I would have added more pages and animations.

## Notes for Future Self
- Take your time and finish each section before moving on.
